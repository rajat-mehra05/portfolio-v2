While learning JavaScript, I had actually missed these topics and was about to switch to React JS. Luckily, I didn't skip these topics and learnt these functions and methods as well. Hence, whoever is learning JavaScript should read this blog before learning React.🙌

# **1. forEach()**

The `forEach()` method calls a function once for each element in an array, without mutating the array. It is one of the useful methods while iterating through items in an array.
`forEach()` takes two arguments - first being the callback function which is called for each item in an array and the second argument is optional which refers to the value of `this` set in the callback.
> Syntax:
array.forEach(callback [ , thisArgument])

#### Here is an example-
```javascript
const companies = [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1972, end: 2004},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1971, end: 2009}
  ];

companies.forEach(company => {
  	console.log(company);
});
//Object { name: "amazon", start: 1971, end: 2001 }
//Object { name: "netflix", start: 1972, end: 2004 }
//Object { name: "flipkart", start: 1971, end: 2009 }
```
`company` is a callback function here. `companies.forEach(company)` executes `company` function for every item in `companies`, setting the iterated item as a first argument. That's how `forEach()` method works.

Now if we want to iterate to items with only name property in the array `companies`, here is how we do it:
```javascript
const companies = [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1972, end: 2004},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1971, end: 2009}
  ];

companies.forEach( company => {
  	console.log(company.name);
});
// "amazon"
// "netflix"
// "flipkart"
```
#### Where to use forEach() ?
`forEach()` is widely used to iterate array items, without breaking and having simultaneously some side-effect. Or you can go for [array methods](https://javascript.info/array-methods) as an alternative.

# **2. filter()**

The `filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. If no elements pass the test, an empty array will be returned.

> Syntax:
array.filter(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
`thisValue` is an optional parameter.

#### Lets say we want to filter out the adults below 21 y
rs of age, here is an example-
```javascript
const ages = [45,67,7,21,4,19,11];

const adultPersons = ages.filter( age => {
 	if(age>=21) {
    	return true;
    }
});
console.log(adultPersons);
// Array [45, 67, 21]
```
We created a new variable `adultPersons` where we could store all the array items of `ages` which passed the test that we provided in the function.

#### Another example of `filter()` method where we want to get companies which started in 1971-
```javascript
const companies = [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1972, end: 2004},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1971, end: 2009}
  ];

const year = companies.filter(company => {
  	if( company.start == "1971") {
    return true;
    }
});
console.log(year);
//output-->  Array [Object { name: "amazon", start: 1971, end: 2001 }, Object { name: "flipkart", start: 1971, end: 2009 }]
```
We got two objects from the array `companies` which include `1971` in `start` category.

# **3. map()**

The `map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function for every array element. This method doesn't execute the function for the array elements without values.
The `map()` method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

> Syntax:
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
`thisValue` is an optional parameter.

#### Here is an example of getting all company names using `map()`-
```javascript
const companies = [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1972, end: 2004},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1971, end: 2009}
  ];

const compNames = companies.map(company => {
  		return company.name;
    });
console.log(compNames);
//Array ["amazon", "netflix", "flipkart"]
```
We got a simple array with all the company names. Easy peasy!✌

Now if we want to get the company names and end year using `map()` method, we can use [template literals/strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) too.
#### Here is an example-
```javascript
const array = [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001, owner: "A"},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1972, end: 2004, owner: "B"},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1971, end: 2009, owner: "C"}
  ];

const compNames = array.map(company =>
   `${company.name} [${company.end} - ${company.owner}]` );

console.log(compNames);
// Array ["amazon [2001 - A]", "netflix [2004 - B]", "flipkart [2009 - C]"]
```
Now we have got an array with each value i.e. company name along with their end year and owner.

#### Another example of `map()` where we can use Math object -
```javascript
const num =[ 4 , 16 , 36];

const numSquareRoot = num.map(number => Math.sqrt(number));
console.log(numSquareRoot);
//Array [2, 4, 6]
```
Simple! isn't it? I hope you have learnt now how to use `map()` method. Practice and you'll learn more.🙌

# **4. sort()**

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric as well as ascending or descending.
> Note -->  the `sort()` method sorts the values as strings in alphabetical and ascending order.
This method works well for strings ("Ant" comes before "Bat"). However, if numbers are sorted as strings, "30" is bigger than "200", because "3" is bigger than "2".
Thus, the `sort()` method generates an incorrect result when sorting numbers.
A "compare function" comes useful for fixing this.

#### Lets say we want to sort the companies on basis of their start years. Here is an example-
```javascript
const companies= [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1971, end: 2001, owner: "A"},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1962, end: 2004, owner: "B"},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1991, end: 2009, owner: "C"}
  ];

//using short method via ternary operators
const sortedCompanies = companies.sort((a,b) => (a.start > b.start ? 1 : -1));
console.log(sortedCompanies);
//Array [Object { name: "netflix", start: 1962, end: 2004, owner: "B" }, Object { name: "amazon", start: 1971, end: 2001, owner: "A" }, Object { name: "flipkart", start: 1991, end: 2009, owner: "C" }]
```
Here the `sort()` method takes a function that takes two values `a` and `b` and compares them on the basis of their `start` date.
Note -> `a` denotes company one and `b` denotes company two.

#### Another example of `sort()` -
```javascript
const num = [34,4,67,12,1];
const sortNum = num.sort();
console.log(sortNum);
//output->  Array [1, 12, 34, 4, 67]

//for ascending order
const numAscend = num.sort((a,b) => a-b);
console.log(numAscend);
//output->  Array [1, 4, 12, 34, 67]

// for descending order
const numDescend = num.sort((a,b)=> b-a);
console.log(numDescend);
//output->  Array [67, 34, 12, 4, 1]
```
# **5. reduce()**

The `reduce()` method reduces the array to a single output value. This method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right). The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator(total).

>Syntax:
array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)

>Note: reduce() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

#### Here is an example of finding sum of numbers in an array using `reduce` method -
```javascript
const num = [45,5,2,10];

const sum = num.reduce(function(total, number){
		return total + number;
},0);

console.log(sum);
// 62
```
Here, we pass two arguments `total` and `number` as arguments in the function. `total` denotes previously returned value of the function and `number` denotes the value of current element. We have also passed second parameter `0` which means its going to start from 0.
You can use arrow functions too. I didn't use arrow functions so that beginners could understand what's happening with the function.

#### Another example of `reduce` method to get total years for all companies-
```javascript
const companies= [
  { name: "amazon" , start: 1970, end: 2000, owner: "A"},
  { name: "netflix" , start: 1960, end: 2000, owner: "B"},
  { name: "flipkart" , start: 1990, end: 2010, owner: "C"}
  ];

const totalYears = companies.reduce((total, company) =>
	total + (company.end - company.start),0);

console.log(totalYears);
//90
```
