## Why I Built This

I watch a lot of YouTube - conference talks, system design deep dives, interviews, podcasts - and most of it is longer than it needs to be. YouTube's "Ask Gemini" feature produces walls of text with no structure, no timestamps, and no way to scan quickly.

I had previously built a web-based version (`yt-video-summariser`) as a full-stack Next.js app, but YouTube blocks transcript requests from cloud/datacenter IPs (AWS, GCP, Vercel) with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" walls. The only workaround was a residential proxy at ~$6/month. And I'm broke af :)

If YouTube blocks server IPs but not home IPs, run the whole thing on the user's machine. That's how Rundownly was born - a desktop app that fetches transcripts directly from your IP, powered by the [YouTube Transcript API](/projects/youtube-transcript-api) library I had built earlier. You paste a YouTube URL, pick a summary length and language, and get a structured summary with clickable timestamps. Nothing to sign up for, nothing to pay for beyond your own API key.

## Why Tauri

I wanted a desktop app with a small footprint. While exploring Tauri and Electron, Tauri was the clear winner. Both the macOS `.dmg` and the Windows installer come in at ~4MB. A bare Electron app ships at 120MB+, roughly 30x the size. Learning about Tauri and Rust along the way was a bonus.
