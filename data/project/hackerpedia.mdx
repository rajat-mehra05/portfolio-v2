## Overview

HackerPedia is a modern, feature-rich Hacker News clone built with React while learning frontend development. This project fetches real-time data from the Hacker News API and delivers a seamless user experience with infinite scrolling, nested comments, and a beautiful dark mode—all without using any state management library like Redux.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - UI framework with modern functional components
- **React Hooks** - State and lifecycle management (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef)
- **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS with theming support
- **Material-UI (MUI)** - Layout components and design system
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing and navigation
- **Axios** - HTTP client for efficient API calls
- **React Spinners** - Beautiful loading animations
- **Context API** - Global theme management
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App capabilities

## Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **Infinite Scroll**: Seamlessly loads more stories as you scroll down
- **Story Metadata**: View points, author, post time, and comment count for each story
- **External Links**: Direct links to original articles with domain preview

### User Interface
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes with persistent localStorage
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Loading States**: Beautiful loading animations using react-spinners

## Technical Highlights

### Smart Caching Strategy
The app implements an intelligent caching system to improve performance and reduce API calls:

- **Cache Duration**: 5 minutes TTL (Time To Live)
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistence across page reloads
- **Capacity**: 100 stories maximum, 40 comment threads maximum
- **Benefits**: Faster navigation, reduced API calls, better UX, no loading spinners for cached content

### Performance Features
- **React Hooks**: Modern functional components with useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef
- **Styled Components**: Theme-aware, scoped CSS-in-JS styling
- **Efficient API Calls**: Axios with error handling and caching
- **Context API**: Global theme management without Redux
- **Smart Caching**: localStorage-based caching with 5-minute TTL and LRU eviction
