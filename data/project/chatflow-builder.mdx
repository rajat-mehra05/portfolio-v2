## Why I Built This

I wanted to understand how node-based visual editors work - the kind you see in tools like n8n, Retool, or Figma's prototyping mode. React Flow was the library I kept seeing recommended, so I picked chatbot flows as the use case: small enough to finish, complex enough to learn from.

The goal was simple: drag nodes onto a canvas, connect them into a conversation flow, edit their content in real-time, and save the result.

## Working Demo

/>

_Drag nodes, connect flows, and edit properties in real-time._

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **React 18** - UI library
- **React Flow 11** - Node-based graph library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Styling

## Key Features

- **Drag and drop** - Add message or button nodes by dragging them from the panel onto the canvas.
- **Visual connections** - Wire nodes together by dragging from source to target handles.
- **Live editing** - Select any node and edit its properties in the settings panel. Changes reflect instantly.
- **Auto-save** - Flow state saves to localStorage automatically.
- **Flow validation** - Built-in validation checks that your flow is properly connected before saving.
- **Two node types** - Text message nodes for conversation content, button nodes for interactive choices.
- **Pan and zoom** - Navigate large flows with standard canvas controls.

## What I Learned

React Flow handles the hard parts of node-based UIs - hit detection, edge routing, viewport transforms - but the data model is yours to design. Getting the node type system right (so adding a third or fourth node type is just a new component and a registry entry) took more thought than the visual layer itself. The lesson: in visual editors, the data model matters more than the rendering.
