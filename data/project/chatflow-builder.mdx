## Overview

Chatflow Builder is a powerful drag-and-drop chatbot flow builder that makes creating conversational workflows intuitive and visual. Built with Next.js and React Flow, it provides a canvas-based interface where you can design complex chatbot interactions by simply dragging nodes and connecting them together.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **React 18** - Modern UI library with hooks
- **React Flow 11** - Interactive node-based graph library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

## Key Features

### Visual Flow Builder
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Easily add nodes by dragging from the nodes panel onto the canvas
- **Visual Connections**: Connect nodes by dragging from source to target handles
- **Interactive Canvas**: Pan, zoom, and navigate your flow with intuitive controls
- **Node Types**: Support for text message nodes and interactive button nodes

### Real-Time Editing
- **Settings Panel**: Edit node properties instantly when selected
- **Live Updates**: Changes reflect immediately on the canvas
- **Property Editing**: Customize text content, button values, and more

### Smart Features
- **Auto-save**: Flow state is automatically saved to localStorage
- **Flow Validation**: Built-in validation ensures proper flow structure before saving
- **Restore Flow**: Easily restore your previous work from local storage
- **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for easy addition of new node types

## Usage

### Building Your Flow
1. **Add Nodes**: Drag a node type (Message or Button) from the "Nodes Panel" on the right
2. **Drop on Canvas**: Place the node anywhere on the canvas
3. **Connect Nodes**: Click and drag from a node's source handle (right side) to another node's target handle (left side)
4. **Edit Properties**: Click on any node to select it and edit its properties in the settings panel
5. **Save Flow**: Click "Save Changes" to validate and save your complete flow

### Node Types
- **Message Nodes**: Create text messages in your chatbot conversation
- **Button Nodes**: Add interactive buttons with custom text and values

## Technical Highlights

### Extensible Architecture
The codebase is structured for easy extension:
- Modular node component system
- Centralized node registry for new types
- Type-safe node definitions with TypeScript
- Utility functions for node creation and management
- Validation rules engine for flow integrity

### Performance Features
- **Efficient State Management**: Optimized React Flow state handling
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Automatic saving with browser storage
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for reliability
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes

## Project Structure

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:
- `app/` - Next.js app directory with pages and layouts
- `components/` - Reusable React components including flow nodes and panels
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions for type safety
- `utils/` - Helper functions for node creation and persistence
- `lib/` - Configuration and validation logic
